There are 5 fields or better say play ground inside the school compound and the main school play ground (also known as "Balur maat " ) just outside the school boundary wall. Annual sport takes place on that field. This a very reputed and reliable school in Sunamganj. The best institution in Sunamganj District for boys. There's been no doubt about this... Is there? </p>
