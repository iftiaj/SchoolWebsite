<p> Currently Jubilee has 2 Hostels. One for the Muslims and another for the Hindu students. Near about 500 students of class VI (6)  to X (10) are staying here. Every day subject wise teachers look after the students.</p>

<p> A high quality food is served in hostel and the menu is fixed. No compromise is done for quality food and the cleanness of the hostel. Occasionally students are brought to park, fair and national festivals for their recreation.</p> </li>


<li> <h3>Libraries :</h3>

<img class ="banner" src="new/lab.jpg" alt="Home" title="image" width="80%" height="60%" />

<p>Jubilee has three science laboratories. housed in the science building. The original Victorian building was substantially extended in the 1960s. The ground floor houses the laboratory of the chemistry department, along with a 50-seat, lecture theatre (The Egerton Room), which is used for the Scientific Society and other meetings. On the first floor there is the physics laboratory, and the two new computer rooms. The top floor houses one biology labs, the newest of which was opened in 2000. In addition, each of the science departments has well-stocked preparation rooms, and smaller rooms with particular functions, such as microbiology, darkrooms for optics experiments, and a well-equipped analytical instruments room for chemistry.</p>

<p>Almost all science masters have their own schoolrooms, which combine a desk area for class teaching, and bench space for practical work. The bench areas have a full range of services fed from flexible overhead or floor-level service points. This arrangement allows great flexibility both in terms of room layout, and in use of time, with the transition between practical and theoretical activity able to be made very quickly.</p>

<p>Safety is a major concern in modern science teaching. All our staff have received appropriate safety training, and a wide range of safety-related equipment, such as fume cupboards (two in fixed cupboards in each chemistry lab plus a number of portable cupboards), is in use.</p>

<p>The science laboratories are serviced by a team of twelve well-qualified technicians and a budget which allows us to purchase the latest equipment.</p>
